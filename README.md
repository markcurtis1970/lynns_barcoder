# Lynn's barcoder

Very bare bones and basic project for a barcoder inventory system.

A lot of this is just at the conceptual stage right now, some of the files mentioned might be changed or not even exist yet!

## Components

- barcode_ui.py - the user interface
- db_comms.py - comms to a given data source
- reader_comms.py - comms to the barcode reader
- valiadation.py - any required data validation
- test.py - for testing things
